## How to Play / Test

### In-Editor

1. Open the project in Unity.
2. Load the scene: `Assets/Scenes/Scene.unity`.
3. Press **Play**.
4. Use **A / S / D** keys to switch lanes for the player.
5. Catch falling eggs and avoid bombs. AI players also compete in other lanes.

### Multiplayer Ready (for later)

- No actual networking now.
- But all player logic, score updates, and input handling are modular and server-authority-ready.

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- Uses dynamic `PlayerId` assignment.
- AI is data-driven via `ScriptableObjects`.
- Sound/UI/Scoring logic respects player/AI distinction.
- Code designed to be scalable with minimal rewrite for networking.
